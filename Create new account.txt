All infos will be saved at file "root.txt"
The information that I will store is:
- Account Number
- First Name + Last Name
- Current_Balance
- National ID Number
- Phone Number
- Account Password
- Account rate
- Account's rate Type
- Starting Date of The Balance
- Date of Birth
- Account holder's most memorable day
    (For The security purpose)
So I will make a structure nammed as:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
|              <<< Account >>>                   |
|string AccountNumber, FirstName,LastName,       |
|PhoneNumber, Password, NID;                     |
|long long LastTransection;                      |
|long double Balance, Rate, Type;                |
|date InitialDate, MemorableDate, DateOfBirth;   |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The format of each Account's infos will be as follows: ('root.txt')
AccountNumber FirstName LastName NID PhoneNumber Password Balance LastTransection Rate Type InitialDate MemorableDate DateOfBirth

Let,
'AccountNumber':
The AccountNumber be a NineDigitNumber which may contain leading zeros
So we can have 10^9 = 1,000,000,000 (One Billion) users
This should be enough for a bank... :P
I will make a file which will contain only the AccountNumbers of the users
And I will let the users to choose their own bank account numbers and then search for it in my indexes of other account numbers. If it dont matches to any existing ID then I will let the users to choose it as his/her ID. 

'Type':
the type of the account is also important. We will consider following types with following code:
- Savings Account (code=1)
- Fixed Deposit (code=2)
- Current Account AKA Business Account(No Interest) (code=3)

Now Let me come to the interface of Create New Account:
< 1st Step >
First Of All I will Ask the user to choose an account number for him/her. which must contain 9 digit and that can have Leading Zeros. Then I will check from my user account number list and then let the user know weather he/she can have that account number or not.
- So Here the overall data will be kept in "root.txt" file.
- And the index will be found at "index.txt" file.
< 2nd Step >
- Then I will pick his/her First name and last name <ok>
- Then I will take his/her NID <ok>
- Then I will ask her Date of Birth 
- Then I will take his/her Phone number
- Then I will take his password
- Then I will take his initial Debit Balance
- Then I will set his last transection
- Then I will ask if it is a VIP account or not if it is a VIP account then I will take a custom rate for the VIP customer. Otherwise I will set the rate to 0.00
- Then I will ask for the account type
- Then I will ask today's date AKA the initial date of the account
- Then I will ask for his/her one memorable date just for security purpose
